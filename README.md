This is a python script that uses a camera to detect your current emotion using Deepface model and then plays a spotify song for that emotion.

This uses Tinker, OpenCV, Deepface, Pygame, Spotipy, dotenv, make sure you have these modules for this script to run.

It has a narration (off by default) using the voice lines in the Voicelines folder in mp3 format,
I used a free AI voice to create them so here is a link to the website i used: https://elevenlabs.io/app/speech-synthesis/text-to-speech . I used Bill as the voice for the recordings.

This was made on a windows machine for a windows machine, you are more then welcome to convert it to your desired OS however i will not provide it, if you want you can add it the project to make it multiversion.

To make this work you will need a .env file with your spotify keys from your own API, names: CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET just add them and it shoukd work if not then just put them directly.

I will not answer any problem that arise with the app so good luck with google.

This was made out of pure fun and isnt meant to be any thing special, so yes it can 100% be optimised and shorten, and I don't care but thank you.
